# PSI

Private Set Intersection protocol based on ECDH and Bloom Filters.

## Requirements

There are requirements for the entire project which each language shares. There also could be requirements for each target language:

### Global Requirements

These are the common requirements across all target languages of this project.

- A compiler such as clang, gcc, or msvc
- [Bazel](https://bazel.build)

## Installation

The repository uses a folder structure to isolate the supported targets from one another:

```
private_set_intersection/<target language>/<sources>
```

### C++

See the [C++ README.md](private_set_intersection/cpp/README.md)

### JavaScript

See the [JavaScript README.md](private_set_intersection/javascript/README.md)

### Go

See the [Go README.md](private_set_intersection/go/README.md)

### Python

See the [Python README.md](private_set_intersection/python/README.md)

## Usage

To use this library in another Bazel project, add the following in your WORKSPACE file:

```
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

git_repository(
   name = "org_openmined_psi",
   remote = "https://github.com/OpenMined/PSI",
   branch = "master",
   init_submodules = True,
)

load("@org_openmined_psi//private_set_intersection:preload.bzl", "psi_preload")

psi_preload()

load("@org_openmined_psi//private_set_intersection:deps.bzl", "psi_deps")

psi_deps()

```

A full description of the protocol can be found in the documentation of the [PsiClient](private_set_intersection/cpp/psi_client.h) class.
The corresponding server class is [PsiServer](private_set_intersection/cpp/psi_server.h).
An example of how to interleave the different phases of the protocol can be found in [psi_server_test.cpp](private_set_intersection/cpp/psi_server_test.cpp).
