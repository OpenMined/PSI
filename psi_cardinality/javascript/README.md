# PSI Cardinality - JavaScript

Private Set Intersection Cardinality protocol based on ECDH and Bloom Filters.

## Installing

To install, run:

```bash
npm install @openmined/psi.js
# or with yarn
yarn add @openmined/psi.js
```

Then import the package:

```javascript
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js'

const server = await PSI.server.createWithNewKey()
const client = await PSI.client.create()
```

By **default**, the package will use the `combined` build with the `wasm` variant for getting started.
This includes both `client` and `server` implementations, but often only one is used. We offer deep import
links to only load what is needed for your specific environment.

The deep import structure is as follows:
`<package name>/<client|server|combined>/<wasm|js>/<umd|es>`

To only load the `client`:

```javascript
// Loads only the client, supporting WebAssembly or asm.js
// with either `umd` (Browser + NodeJS) or `es` (ES6 modules)
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/client/wasm/umd'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/client/wasm/es'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/client/js/umd'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/client/js/es'

const client = await PSI.client.create()
// PSI.server is not implemented
```

To only load the `server`:

```javascript
// Loads only the server, supporting WebAssembly or asm.js
// with either `umd` (Browser + NodeJS) or `es` (ES6 modules)
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/server/wasm/umd'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/server/wasm/es'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/server/js/umd'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/server/js/es'

const server = await PSI.server.createWithNewKey()
// PSI.client is not implemented
```

To **manually** load the `combined`:

```javascript
// Loads the combined server and client, supporting WebAssembly or asm.js
// with either `umd` (Browser + NodeJS) or `es` (ES6 modules)
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/combined/wasm/umd'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/combined/wasm/es'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/combined/js/umd'
import PSI from '@openmined/psi.js/combined/js/es'

const server = await PSI.server.createWithNewKey()
const client = await PSI.client.create()
```

## Example

```javascript
// Create new server and client instances
const server = await PSICardinality.server.createWithNewKey()
const client = await PSICardinality.client.create()

// Define mutually agreed upon parameters
const fpr = 0.001 // false positive rate (0.1%)
const numClientElements = 10 // Size of the client set to check
const numTotalElements = 100 // Maximum size of the server set

// Example server set of data
const serverInputs = Array.from(
  { length: numTotalElements },
  (_, i) => `Element ${i}`
)

// Example client set of data to check
const clientInputs = Array.from(
  { length: numClientElements },
  (_, i) => `Element ${i * 2}`
)

// Create the setup message that will later
// be used to compute the intersection. Send to client
const serverSetup = server.createSetupMessage(
  fpr,
  numClientElements,
  serverInputs
)

// Create a client request to send to the server
const clientRequest = client.createRequest(clientInputs)

// Process the client's request and return to the client
const serverResponse = server.processRequest(clientRequest)

// Client computes the intersection and the server has learned nothing!
const intersection = client.processResponse(serverSetup, serverResponse)
// intersection = 10
```

## Compiling and Running

### Requirements

Ensure your environment has the following global dependencies:

- [Bazel](https://bazel.build)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Next, ensure you have updated submodules

```
npm run submodule:update
```

Then, update and initialize `emsdk`

```
npm run em:update
npm run em:init
```

Now, install the rest of the dev dependencies

```
npm install
```

To build the client, server, or combined (both client and server) for WebAssembly and pure JS

```
npm run build:client
npm run build:server
npm run build:combined

# or all three
npm run build
```

Run the tests or generate coverage reports. **Note** tests are run using the WASM variant.

```
npm run test

# or to see coverage
npm run coverage
```

## Benchmarks

Build the benchmark for WebAssembly, pure JS, or both variants

```
npm run build:benchmark:wasm
npm run build:benchmark:js

# or both
npm run build:benchmark
```

Finally, run the benchmark for WebAssembly or pure JS

```
npm run benchmark:wasm
npm run benchmark:js
```

## Publishing

Ensure we start with a clean build

`npm run clean`

Build the client, server, and combined (client and server)

`npm run build`

Compile typescript

`npm run compile`

Test your changes and check code coverage

```bash
# Test TS
npm run test

# Test compiled JS
npm run test:js

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage
```

Then, bundle all the files

`npm run rollup`

Now, we can test publish

`npm run publish:test`

Finally, publish the bundle

`npm run publish`

**Note**: The default `npm publish` has been disabled to prevent publishing of the entire project files.
Instead, we have a custom override which will publish the npm package from a specific directory.
This allows us to publish a single package with shortened deep import links that specify the
different targets listed above.
